Please Read the Project Report.
This project report describes the process involved in developing Artificial Intelligence for 2-D computer board game known as “Ludo” using Greenfoot java IDE.  
Greenfoot allows object orientation using Java. Create 'actors' which live in 'world' to build simulations, and other graphical programs. Greenfoot provides visual and interactive environment to implement various AI concepts.
This report discusses the game overview, including the description and game play, and then focuses on the game design, approach describing how the game is implemented and the programming functions, algorithms and libraries used in the design.
